# Sample-based_Semi-convex_Hull_Tree
In this paper, a novel tree structure, namely semi-convex hull tree, is proposed, and based on it a fast nearest neighbor (NN) query algorithm for large scale data is given. In the novel tree, each node represents a convex set, in fact semi-convex hull, which consists of some linear constraints. The new NN algorithm ﬁlters large amounts of redundant distance computations by quadratic programming (QP). In order to perform the proposed algorithm on GPUs, a simpliﬁed quadratic programming is also proposed to retrieve approximate lower bound of the distance from a query point to a node. In addition, a sample based version of the proposed algorithm is developed as well, which accelerates the original semi-convex hull tree much in large scale data. Experiments conducted on diﬀerent GPUs show that the proposed algorithm is promising, which yields valuable improvements and superiority to the other NN query methods, including k-d tree, cover tree etc.
